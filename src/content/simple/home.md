# Hey


I'm a self-taught front-end developer and UI designer, passionate about starting my own ventures. My approach to business is all about keeping things simple and practical, following basic principles that work. I believe in sticking to a plan and doing things reliably. Consistency is key for me - it's what keeps everything running smoothly.

# now

Enjoying family, life and becoming the best part of me. This "Now" page reflects my current priorities and goals, and I will update it regularly as my focus and activities change over time.

## What I am doing
*As of December 2023, here are a few things I'm focused on:*
- **Eating only meat**: Embracing a carnivore diet for health and simplicity.
- **Building an office on my garage**: Creating a dedicated space for focus and creativity.
- **Morning runs before I start working**: Prioritizing physical health and mental clarity.
- **Working on Lexington themes and upcoming ventures**: Dedicating my full-time efforts to grow my projects.
- **Waking up at 06:00**: Maximizing the day to enjoy more quality time with my family.
- **Being consistent in working on my projects**: Avoiding distractions to maintain progress and momentum.
- **Reading Jordan B. Peterson's '12 Rules for Life'**: Gaining insights for personal development and challenging perspectives.


## What I am not doing
*To prioritize the things that matter most, here are a few things Iâ€™m intentionally not doing right now:*
- **Wasting time**: Focusing on productivity and meaningful activities.
- **This is my 25th year without watching TV**: Choosing to spend my time on more engaging and enriching activities.
- **I am not neglecting my physical and mental health**: Regularly exercising and taking time to unwind and relax outdoors to maintain well-being.


As I navigate through these priorities, I'm learning every day and embracing the challenges and opportunities that come my way. I'm grateful for the journey and excited about what the future holds.

All components are designed for compatibility with the latest version of Tailwind CSS. To access the most current release of Tailwind CSS, please update it via npm.

Except for the customized blue color, all components adhere to the standard Tailwind CSS configuration. Certain components also require the use of first-party plugins, such as:

- @tailwindcss/forms
- @tailwindcss/typography
- @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio
